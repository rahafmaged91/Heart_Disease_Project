Comprehensive Machine Learning Pipeline for Heart Disease Prediction
ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This project presents a full, end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting heart disease risk using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. The workflow encompasses the entire data science lifecycle, from data acquisition and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, optimization, and final deployment via an interactive web application. The primary objective is to build a reliable predictive model and present it in an accessible format for real-time inference.

âœ¨ Live Demo
The application can be accessed via the public URL generated by Ngrok.
(Note: The Ngrok tunnel must be active to access the application. Please run the run_ngrok.py script as described in the Usage section.)

ðŸŒŸ Key Features
Automated Data Preprocessing: Implements a robust pipeline for handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

Advanced Feature Engineering: Utilizes both statistical (Chi-Square) and model-based (Random Forest, RFE) techniques for optimal feature selection.

Supervised & Unsupervised Learning: Employs a suite of classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.) for prediction and clustering algorithms (K-Means) for pattern discovery.

Rigorous Model Optimization: Leverages GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to systematically fine-tune model hyperparameters for peak performance.

Interactive Web UI: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit for real-time predictions and data exploration.

Reproducible Pipeline: The final model is saved as a complete pipeline, ensuring that all preprocessing steps are consistently applied during inference.

ðŸ“ˆ Usage
Running the Predictive UI:
To launch the interactive web application, execute the following command from the project's root directory:

streamlit run ui/app.py

Deploying for Public Access (Optional):
To make the application publicly accessible, first configure your Ngrok authtoken and then run the deployment script:

# Set up your token once
ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_NGROK_AUTHTOKEN>

# Run the deployment script
python run_ngrok.py

ðŸ“Š Results & Findings
The project successfully identified a high-performance model for heart disease prediction. After comprehensive feature selection and hyperparameter tuning, the Logistic Regression model emerged as the best performer.

Best Model: Logistic Regression

Test Accuracy: 88.3%

Key Features: The model's performance relies on a carefully selected set of 12 features, including thal, ca, cp, and exang.

The final model, packaged into a complete preprocessing and prediction pipeline, demonstrated a strong ability to distinguish between patients with and without heart disease, providing a reliable tool for risk assessment.
