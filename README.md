Comprehensive Machine Learning Pipeline for Heart Disease Prediction
📋 Project Overview
This project presents a full, end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting heart disease risk using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. The workflow encompasses the entire data science lifecycle, from data acquisition and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, optimization, and final deployment via an interactive web application. The primary objective is to build a reliable predictive model and present it in an accessible format for real-time inference.

✨ Live Demo
The application can be accessed via the public URL generated by Ngrok.

(Note: The Ngrok tunnel must be active to access the application. Please run the run_ngrok.py script as described in the Usage section.)

🌟 Key Features
Automated Data Preprocessing: Implements a robust pipeline for handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

Advanced Feature Engineering: Utilizes both statistical (Chi-Square) and model-based (Random Forest, RFE) techniques for optimal feature selection.

Supervised & Unsupervised Learning: Employs a suite of classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.) for prediction and clustering algorithms (K-Means) for pattern discovery.

Rigorous Model Optimization: Leverages GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to systematically fine-tune model hyperparameters for peak performance.

Interactive Web UI: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit that allows for real-time predictions based on user-input health metrics.

Reproducible & Deployable: The entire project is containerized in a structured format with all necessary scripts and models, ready for deployment.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Language: Python 3.9

Core Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

# Run the deployment script
python run_ngrok.py

📊 Results & Findings
The project successfully identified a high-performance model for heart disease prediction. After comprehensive feature selection and hyperparameter tuning, the Random Forest Classifier emerged as the best-performing model, achieving a Test Accuracy of over 90%. The model demonstrated a strong ability to distinguish between patients with and without heart disease, validated through cross-validation and various performance metrics including F1-score and AUC.
