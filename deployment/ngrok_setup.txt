==================================================== How to Deploy the Streamlit App using Ngrok
This guide provides the steps to make your local Streamlit application publicly accessible over the internet using Ngrok.

Step 1: Install Required Library
If you haven't already, install the pyngrok library, which allows Python to control Ngrok.

pip install pyngrok

Step 2: Sign Up for Ngrok and Get Your Authtoken
Go to the Ngrok website: https://ngrok.com/

Sign up for a free account.

Once logged in, navigate to the "Your Authtoken" section on your dashboard:
https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken

Copy your unique authtoken. It's a long string of characters.

Step 3: Configure Ngrok with Your Authtoken
Open your terminal or command prompt in the project's root directory (Heart_Disease_Project) and run the following command. Replace <YOUR_AUTHTOKEN> with the token you copied in the previous step.

ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_AUTHTOKEN>

This command only needs to be run once. It saves your token to a configuration file on your computer.

Step 4: Run the Deployment Script
A helper script run_ngrok.py has been created to automate the process of starting both the Streamlit app and the Ngrok tunnel.

From your project's root directory, simply run:

python run_ngrok.py

What Happens Next?
The script will first start the Streamlit application in the background on a specific port (e.g., 8502).

It will then create a secure public URL using Ngrok that tunnels to your local application.

The public URL will be printed in your terminal. It will look something like this:
https://<random-characters>.ngrok.io

Step 5: Access Your Live Application
Copy the public URL from the terminal.

Paste it into any web browser on any device.

Anyone with this link can now access and interact with your live Streamlit application as long as the script is running in your terminal.

To stop the application, simply press Ctrl+C in the terminal window where the script is running.
